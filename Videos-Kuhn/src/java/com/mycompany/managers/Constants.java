    /* =========== Our Design Decision ===========
        We decided to use directories external to our application 
        for the storage and retrieval of user's files.
    
        We do not want to use a database for the following reasons: 
            (a) Database storage and retrieval of large files as 
                BLOB (binary large object) degrades performance.
            (b) BLOBs increase the database complexity.
    
        Therefore, we use the following two external directories 
        for the storage and retrieval of photos.
